============

Regular expression evaluator that I wrote quickly.

It's a Mac OS X widget that can evaluate regular expressions. It has edge cases and bugs, but is a good starting point for anyone that wants to finish it out. Version 2.0 was in progress, but never finished. It had incredible contextual highlighting and hints, but I lost much of the code.

I built this during a project due to the massive amounts of Regex expressions I was writing. To date, it has earned me $6.00 US from the donation link.
